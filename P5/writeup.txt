Writeup Guidelines:

– What you changed from the template and why, especially related to your selection strategies,
fitness functions, crossover and mutation operators, etc.
– Something about each of your two favorite levels: Why do you like them? How many generations
did it take and how many seconds to generate these levels?

1. 
Selection Strategy:
Eletist selection - Pick random number of maps from 1% to 25% of the original population, choose the ones with the best fitness to 
become the parents for the next generation.

Roulette selection - Sums up the fitness of the population then creates an array of all the probalbites of the population, then selects random level based
on the array of probalbites

Both appedn thier best fit to the results and then using every cobination of the best parents it crteates the children


Uniform crossover - Takes two parents, makes two copies of them. We have a new map P filled with random numbers from 0-1. So if the number is less than .5 
we swap with one parent and if its above .5 we swap with the other. 

Mutation - Randomly pick if its gonna mutate a random set of columns, rows, or positions. After it picks, its gonna iterate through it
and if its an block or an empty space it has less than 25% to be replaced with a diffrent block, a less than 50% chance to be shifted 
Chance that it won't mutate: 10% (aka if a random number from 0-1 is less than 0.1)

Writeup Part 2
Upon switching it to the Individual_DE I notice that the levle tend to have way more open space as well that it tend to take a slower time to get to 
future generations when modifythin the generate successors to include both a selectors

Mutate Function: 

The `mutate` function in the `Individual_DE` class performs mutation on an individual's genome, introducing slight changes to its design elements (DEs). 
It begins by randomly selecting a design element from the genome with a probability of 10%. Once a DE is chosen, it randomly selects an aspect of the DE 
(e.g., x-coordinate, y-coordinate, type, etc.) to modify. The specific modifications depend on the type of DE. For example, if the DE is a 4-block, it can 
change the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, or breakability property. The modifications are done using random offsets within specified ranges to ensure the new DEs
remain within valid bounds. After the mutation, the modified genome is returned.

Generate Children Function:

The `generate_children` function in the `Individual_DE` class implements the Differential Evolution (DE) crossover strategy. It takes two parents, self and other, 
and randomly selects two crossover points (pa and pb) to perform the crossover. It splits the genomes of self and other at these crossover points, creating two parts 
(a_part and b_part) from each parent. It then combines the a_part from self and b_part from other to create a new genome ga. Similarly, it combines the a_part from other 
and b_part from self to create a new genome gb. These two new genomes are the children generated from the crossover. The function also involves a mutation step by calling the `mutate` 
function on both children to introduce further variability. The function returns two new individuals representing the children.

3. The random_individual has bben modified to do the following where the generated level is initialized with a floor and walls. 
The function then randomly adds holes, pipes, stairs, platforms, enemies, and coins to the level, respecting certain constraints. 
The number of each element (holes, pipes, stairs, platforms, enemies, and coins) is determined randomly 
within predefined ranges. The function ensures that pipes are not created in the air, and it also considers weighting different tile types for variability. 

Remember to do this:
Improve the fitness function and mutation operator (and potentially crossover) in Individual_DE.
It’s OK if it’s different from the Grid version; you may want to make assumptions ab
